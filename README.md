# swagger-katharsis
Generating Swagger definition for Katharsis JSONAPI applications

## Goals

- Provide a servlet to generate a swagger.json or .yml at runtime based on Katharsis and Swagger annotations.

## Status

Some tests were made in unit tests with researching available/usable annotations in Katharsis and Swagger. However, it's not there yet to cut a release soon.
I will start working on this soon. Stay tuned! :-)
